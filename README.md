This workspace is a collection of constants and tools for interoperating US Customary and SI units of length/displacement, with a focus on avoiding unnecessary loss of precision and idempotency.

In the `joto_constants` package, `IOTA` is defined as one ninth of a nanometer.
This allows common fractions of an inch (ten-thousandths, desktop publishing points, and sixty-fourths) and nanometers to be represented as integers.
Using this base unit, combinations of lengths in either [US customary units](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units>) or [SI units](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units>) can be added, subtracted, and multiplied without loss of precision.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

These packages have been verified to compile with **Rust 1.64** and later.

Future versions might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change, and as such can even happen with small patch releases.
